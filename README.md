Tic Tac Toe Python Project

This is a Python implementation of the classic Tic Tac Toe game.

About this project

I’m a computer engineering graduate learning Python from scratch. This project was a practice exercise to improve my coding skills and understand how to structure functions, handle user input, and manage game logic.

I faced a challenge combining all my functions into a working game. I initially tried editing my instructor’s code, but it didn’t run properly. Eventually, I asked GPT to help me debug and combine all my functions into a working version.

Files

Tic Tac Toe (first try).ipynb – My first attempt (did not know how to continue)

Tic Tac Toe (final attempt).ipynb – My final non-working attempt (functions combined were not by me, but everything else was written by me with little to non guidance from my instructor)

tic_tac_toe_final.py – Fully working version after debugging and combining functions (with GPT’s help)

What I learned

Using functions effectively

Checking valid moves and win conditions

Creating a game loop

Debugging and iterating on code

This project reflects my learning journey and the process of improving my Python skills step by step.
